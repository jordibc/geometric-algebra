# Future developments

Some of the things I'd like to explore with this library:

- Create tutorials, maybe using [Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/)
  (or [Clerk](https://clerk.vision/)?)
  - See also [Clojure Civitas](https://clojurecivitas.github.io/about.html)
    and this nice talk:
    https://clojurecivitas.github.io/conferences/conj2025/workshop/scicloj/sharing.html
- Maybe get involved with [Scicloj](https://scicloj.github.io/)
- Implement examples from the book "Geometric Algebra for Physicists"
  and similar references
- Use [quil](https://github.com/quil/quil) or
  [threejs](https://threejs.org/) to create images / interactive
  graphics that use the power of geometric algebra
- Write examples similar to the ones in [ganja.js](https://enkimute.github.io/ganja.js/)
  - In particular be able to do all this!
    https://enkimute.github.io/ganja.js/examples/galculator.html
- Make sure that the definition for dual (and thus antiwedge) that I
  use are consistent with common usage (and/or note the differences)
